                                    <br>Stand with a barbell, bend your hips while keeping your back straight, and then
                                    lift the weight up to your body:
                                    <br>-Stand behind the barbell with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend at the hips,
                                    and grasp the bar a little wider than shoulder width
                                    <br>Form tips:
                                    <br>Keep your spine neutral, avoid overarching or rounding your spine, and keep a
                                    neutral gaze.
                                    <br>Safety tips:
                                    <br>Avoid the bent-over row if you have lower back pain, and be careful if you use
                                    heavier weights. <br>-If you experience pain in your shoulder or back, stop the
                                    exercise and consult a doctor or physical therapist.

                                    <br>It is typically performed seated, facing towards the machine, where you pull
                                    a long bar attached to the cable, towards your chest, and then slowly extend
                                    your arms back to starting position.
                                    <br>Form and Safety Tips:
                                    <br>-Maintain good posture and keep your back straight.
                                    <br>-Avoid arching your lower back.
                                    <br>-Don't swing the weight backwards to build momentum.
                                    <br>-Maintain control of the weight and don't let the bar rise too quickly.
                                    <br>-If you can't maintain good form, lower the weight.

                                <p class="card-text">How to do it:
                                    <br>The seated cable row is performed on a weighted horizontal cable machine
                                    with a bench and footplates. Sit on the bench with your knees bent and grasp
                                    the cable attachment (often a triangle handle or a bar). Then position
                                    yourself with your knees slightly bent, grabbing the handle with your arms.
                                    Without curling the lower back over, brace the abdominal and slowly begin to
                                    row.
                                    <br> Form tips:
                                    <br>-Pull the handle and weight back toward the lower abdomen while trying
                                    not to use the momentum of the row too much by moving the torso backward
                                    with the arms.
                                    <br>-Target the middle to upper back by keeping your back straight and
                                    squeezing your shoulder blades together as you row, keeping your chest out.
                                    <br>-Return the handle forward under tension to full stretch, remembering to
                                    keep that back straight even though flexed at the hips. Repeat the exercise
                                    for the desired number of repetitions.
                                    <br>Safety tips:
                                    <br>-Be cautious if you have an existing or past shoulder or lower back
                                    injury. You may talk to a healthcare provider to see if it is advised. Stop
                                    the exercise if you feel any sharp pain.

                                <ol>
                                    <li>Walk to the bar. Stand with your mid-foot under the bar. Your
                                        shins shouldn't touch it yet. Put your heels hip-width apart,
                                        narrower
                                        than on squats. Point your toes out 15°.</li>
                                    <li>Grab the bar. Bend over without bending your legs. Grip the bar
                                        narrow, about shoulder-width apart like on the overhead press. Your
                                        arms
                                        must be vertical when looking from the front.</li>
                                    <li>Bend your knees. Drop into position by bending your knees until
                                        your shins touch the bar. Do NOT let the bar move away from your
                                        mid-foot. If it moves, start from scratch with step one.</li>
                                    <li>Lift your chest. Straighten your back by raising you chest. Do not
                                        change your position - keep the bar over your mid-foot, your shins
                                        against the bar, and your hips where they are.</li>
                                    <li>Pull. Take a big breath, hold it and stand up with the weight.
                                        Keep the bar in contact with your legs while you pull. Don't shrug
                                        or
                                        lean back at the top. Lock your hips and knees.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>Form and Safety Tips:</p>
                                <p>The safest way to Dead lift is with your spine neutral. Setup with
                                    the normal inward curve in your lower back. Maintain this position while
                                    you pull the weight off the floor to the lockout. The pressure on your
                                    spinal discs will be even.</p>
